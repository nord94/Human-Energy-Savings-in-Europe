> _Turning sweat into watts!_ 🚴⚡

This project estimates **how much electricity could be generated** if the entire population of any European country completed the **WHO-recommended** amount of exercise using **energy-producing gym machines**.

## 💡 Project Idea

- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** recommends that adults perform at least **150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week**.
- Many **modern gym machines** (e.g., bikes, ellipticals) can **harvest energy** from workouts.
- By combining **population data** and **machine efficiency**, we estimate the **potential energy output** for each country.

🔋 **Imagine** millions of people exercising — and **generating clean energy** at the same time!
